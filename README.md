## BACKGROUND
We were asked to complete an app that mirrored AirBnB's user journey and layout, but we were instructed to be original in our products. As Shingo (lead front-end dev) is a snowboarding prodigy, we took inspiration from that and decided to have a snowboard renting platfom that addressed the issue of users going to other places without their own gear and not wanting to rent gear from rental shops because of the price and/or quality. Instead they could use our platform to rent new and/or custom gear from other users and they could pick it up either on the way or at a location close by where they were snowboarding.  

## ROLES
* I took on project management duties and was responsible for developing the presentation, as well as creating the logo, implementing a sorting feature, and fixing front-end issues.
* Shunjiro as lead dev took on all the duties for Heroku pushes, code quality, and fixing merge issues. 
* James was our lead back-end dev, as well as creating and maintaining the map system seen on the main landing page. 
* Shingo was responsible for all things front end., including making the boxes for each of the items listed. 

## DEVELOPMENT
* We started by planning our user's journey from start to finish on a simple spreadsheet. As there were 2 users (the owner and customer) we had to chart out both journeys and their corresponding CRUD paths.
* We then used <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/4tHWYDKT8S5iZ9SoE2BJi1/Snoared">Figma</a> to draw a mockup of the progression from page to page and what the users would interact with
* Finally we got our Heroku and Trello up and running, so that we could track our progress and remind ourselves about what was due everyday. 

My goal here was to make sure that everybody knew what their tasks were everyday, and there was no confusion about what was to be done.

## BACK-END
* Rails was the back-end skeleton using the MVC model and we made sure to include some quality seeds for all our students and tutors, especially because we wanted to show the process from start to finish

## FRONT-END
* Shingo did an awesome job in creating a quality layout ordered cards to make the viewing as simple as possible. His goal here was to ensure that both the owner and customer could see everything they needed to on one page, as opposed to just clicking multiple times to reach another page.
